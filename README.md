# Head Movement Tracker: Corporate Performance Assessment

> A satirical head-movement game that evaluates your focus — and fires you if you lose it.

## What is this?

A real-time gaze-tracking game built with **MediaPipe** and **PyQt5**. Your webcam tracks your head pose and translates it into a gaze position on screen. Your job: keep your eyes on the moving target while a fake corporate OS emails you, asks you to type buzzwords, and ultimately judges your performance.

Three escalating levels. Three increasingly unhinged environments. One HR verdict.

## Demo

<!-- SCREENSHOT: All three levels side-by-side or a GIF showing the target moving against the spreadsheet/Gmail/Slides backgrounds -->
<!-- Insert screenshot here — ideally a GIF or a 3-panel image showing Level 1 (Sheets), Level 2 (Gmail), Level 3 (Slides) -->

| Level | Theme | Target Behavior |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Google Sheets | Slow, predictable DVD bounce |
| 2 | Gmail Inbox | Faster bounce + dripping emails |
| 3 | Google Slides | Chaotic stochastic movement |

**Level 1 — Google Sheets**

### How gaze tracking works

1. MediaPipe FaceMesh detects 468 3D facial landmarks each frame.
2. Five key landmarks (nose tip, chin, left/right cheeks, forehead) define a head orientation.
3. Yaw and pitch angles are extracted and smoothed over 16 frames to reduce jitter.
4. Angles are mapped linearly to screen coordinates (±35° yaw / ±18° pitch spans the full display).
5. Press `C` to set the current pose as the "looking straight ahead" reference.
